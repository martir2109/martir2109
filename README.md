🏃🏼‍♀️ During the past year, I've taken up an interest in running.

🧶 I love getting creative and picking up new skills. I enjoy crocheting and sewing in my free time.

🎸 I recently decided to learn how to play my favorite song from the game The Last of Us 2, called "Future Days" by Pearl Jam. I’m in the beginning phase, but I’m getting there slowly but surely.
